# Dotfiles
A repo that holds my linux dotfiles, if you like the way it looks, feel free to use it!
I decided to make this a repo for all my dot-files in general, since as i said in a past commint, I think its arbitrary to use 1 repo for 1 thing.
# What's new?
- Completely overhauled i3, now using based dwm
