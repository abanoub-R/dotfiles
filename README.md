# Dotfiles
A repo that holds my linux dotfiles, if you like the way it looks, feel free to use it!
I decided to make this a repo for all my dot-files in general, since as i said in a past commint, I think its arbitrary to use 1 repo for 1 thing.
# What's new?
- updated and patched bootstrap
- added missing maim scripts used in the dwm build but not actually present in the repo
- changed urxvt colorscheme, features less saturated versions of the default 16 colors for a better look on the terminal
