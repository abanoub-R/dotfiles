# Dotfiles
A repo that holds my linux dotfiles, if you like the way it looks, feel free to use it!
# What's new?
I decided to make this a repo for all my dot-files in general, since as i said in a past commint, I think its arbitrary to use 1 repo for 1 thing.
Completely overhauled i3wm configs, now features a vibrant green theme to go with manjaro/linux mint
Fixed i3 config issue where the side of the window would be blue and not like the rest
