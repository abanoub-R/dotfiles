# i3-black-and-orange V1
A black and orange i3 dotfile/config repo

This repo contains dotfiles for i3wm for a black and orange look shown below![Screenshot from 2021-09-07 19-53-40](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90291414/132424983-13fa5aa5-cc34-47f9-b9c6-fd57df4e8b34.png)
# Features
These dotfiles contain a theme for i3, as well as a conf file that removes all of the unneccessary junk in i3status and makes it more simple, also uses a custom font (Yosemite San Francisco)

# Setup
Setup is simple, I made this section for new users of i3. 
You'll need the yosemite san francisco font, to get it put the .fonts folder in your home directory.

Anyways, to use these dotfiles,place:

"config" into "~/.config/i3/"


"i3status.conf" into "/etc/"

# Up next
Up until now I haven't made anything on here yet, Though I might make an auto install script that lets you customize without diving into dotfiles.
